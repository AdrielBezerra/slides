## New era?

- Data variety increased.
- Important data today:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="23%", fig.align='default'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("imgs/friends.jpg", "imgs/acordao.png", "imgs/wave.png"))
```

---

## Deep Learning

- Recent popularity and hype.
- Astonishing case studies.
- Different terminology

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/deepl.png")
```

---

## Problems

- Many (too many?) people using it acritically.

--

- Market is demanding.

--

- We don't learn that in undergrad courses (or do we?)

--

### Are statisticians becoming obsolete?

---

## Don't panic!

- The definition of Data Science does not really matter.

--

- What we should discuss is how to actually **DO** data science

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/data-science.png")
```

---

## Don't panic!

### There are many false cognates.

--

### Our course IS useful.

--

### We need to adapt our mindset and develop ourselves.

## Logistic regression

```{r, out.height="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/glm.png")
```

$$\mathbb E(Y_i) = g^{-1}(\alpha + x_i\beta)$$

---

## Deep learning

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/y1.png")
```

$$f(x) = \sigma(wx + b)$$

- Coincidence?

# What's my role?

# we give data science direction

--

In a Gradient Descent optimization, the **gradient** gives the direction, and the **learning rate** gives the size of the step.

$$\beta_{\text{new}} = \beta_{\text{old}} - \alpha\nabla_\beta(\text{loss})$$

--

In data science, statisticians' role is to be the **gradient**, and computer scientists' role is to be the **learning rate**.

$$DS_{\text{new}} = DS_{\text{old}} - cs * stat (errors)$$

# What we want?

---

## More registered statisticians (CONRE)

```{r, fig.height=6}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/img03.png")
```

---

## More undergrad courses, less evasion

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/img04.png")

## Work with other data scientists

# What should we do?

---

# What do you want?

--

## LEARN (L)

- Learn many things, write papers, exercise your curiosity

--

## RESOLVE (R)

- Earn money, create your startup, raise a family

--

## SHARE (S)

- Share your profession, be relevant on the web, help the community

---

# Focus

--
## 1. [LSR] Integrate communities

--
## 2. [SLR] Be relevant on the web

--
## 3. [LRS] Study, learn, update, use R (and python)

--
## 4. [RSL] Use what the university give to you

--
## 5. [RLS] Be relevant in the university
